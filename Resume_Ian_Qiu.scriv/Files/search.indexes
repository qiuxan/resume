            <Text>Dear Hiring Manager,
I am excited to apply for the Software Developer position at SPL. With over seven years of experience building and modernising enterprise-grade applications across eCommerce, SaaS, and public-sector platforms, I bring a strong mix of technical depth, user focus, and collaborative problem-solving that aligns well with SPL’s innovation-driven culture.
At Munro Footwear Group, I led full-stack development using React, Next.js, .NET Core, and Azure, integrating large-scale ERP and logistics systems to streamline operations and enhance customer experience. Previously at RM Education, I redeveloped OECD’s PISA 2025 assessment platform and refactored its architecture to .NET Core microservices, significantly improving scalability and maintainability. These roles honed my ability to translate business requirements into robust, high-performing solutions—precisely the kind of value SPL seeks in advancing its internal and customer-facing applications.
I am particularly drawn to SPL’s commitment to operational excellence and sustainability through technology. I am eager to contribute my expertise in Software Development to support your mission of becoming a world-class provider through digital innovation.
Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and passion for clean, scalable software can contribute to SPL’s continued success.
Warm regards, Ian Qiu
